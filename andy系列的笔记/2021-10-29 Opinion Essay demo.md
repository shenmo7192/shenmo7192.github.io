# Is using linux distribution in daily lives meaningful or meaningless



Some people thinks using Linux distributions in daily lives is nothing more than looking for trouble, some others may think it is meaningful to use it.

As for me, I think Using Linux Distributions is meaningful

As we all know, most of people choose Windows as their operating system on desktops, laptops and even tablets. There are a lot of reasons to do so, such as it has the best software support and has a better hardware compatibility. However, that doesn’t means that using Linux Distros is purely looking for trouble.

Firstly, Linux distros are mostly opensourced. If a software is opensourced, that means everyone can get access to its source code conveniently, and everyone can get the product by compiling by themselves. That means, if the developer tried to make backdoors or trojan viruses embedded in their operating system, they have to make it exposed to everyone, which is very dangerous to the virus developer. Also, opensource encourages people to join in the developing process, which also benifitial to both developers and users. That makes using Linux distros a very safety choice.

Secondly, Monopoly always leads to problems, so an opensourced warrior is needed to break monopolies. Let us look back, in the 1990s, in the field of browsers, the Netscape was defeated by Internet Explorer(IE), monopoly formed. Then the winner began do evil. From 2000 to 2008, Microsoft only updated 3 main version of IE browser, which blocked the development of web technique. Millions of web developers had to change there code because of IE's out-of-date speed and extreamely poor support for new html standards. Also many flaws happened on IE. The experience of Internet surfing dropped greatly because of the monopoly. However, after the opensourced competitor *firefox* and *Chromium* join the competition, IE-monopoly ended and now opensource-based browsers became the mainstream and internet experience has been significantly improved.  If Microsoft get the most market share of operating system, they would do evil again. Now they are incerting A.D. plugins in the dock bar of Windows. If there are no strong competitor in desktop OS field, they will cannibalize our right a bit by a bit. So it’s wise to support the competitor to inhibit the process.

Also, it can be awesome to get the control of your entire computer. When you are using Windows, you are likely controling a black box and the OS is the master of your computer.  You type in commands but you don't know what would happens. Also the black box will do things that against your wish (such as forced upgrade, poping up A.D.s and uploading data in the background) and the tools they supplied can not work well sometimes(sometimes you just can not mount your UDisk or can not start your Wifi AP and you can get nothing important to solve the problem). If you are using linux distros, these "black box" are not black. You can get the error log and infomations easily and get the source of the "black box " to locate the problem. So you are the master of your computer. Linux makes your computer a better tool for you in a very geek style. 

That's the reasons why I'm using Linux distro as my daily OS, and I highly recommend anyone who has strong hands-on ablility and a heart full of curiosity to try Linux.
